Final Project
Simple Interest Calculator

A simple Bash script that calculates the simple interest based on the principal amount, annual interest rate, and time period in years.

Description
This project is part of the IBM Git & GitHub Final Project. The script is designed to demonstrate basic Bash scripting skills, including taking user input and performing arithmetic operations in a Linux-based terminal environment.

 Formula Used
The script calculates interest using the standard formula:
I = (P*R*T)/100

P = Principal amount
R = Rate of interest per year
T = Time period in years
